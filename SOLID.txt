SRP - Single Responsibility Principle

    We should separate things that change for different reasons

DIP - Dependency inversion Principle

    High level components should not depend on low level components. They should depend on abstractions.

OCP - Open/Closed Principle

    Closed for modification, open for extension. Create extension points to avoid source code modification and bugs.
